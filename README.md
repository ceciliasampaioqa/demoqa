# 🧪 Demo QA Cypress Automated Test Suite

[![Cypress](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested%20with-Cypress-3e873c.svg)](https://www.cypress.io/)
[![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-22.13.0-brightgreen)](https://nodejs.org/)
[![CI](https://github.com/ceciliasampaioqa/demoqa/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ceciliasampaioqa/demoqa/actions)

Automated end-to-end and API test suite for the [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/) web application using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

This project simulates real user behavior and validates core functionalities of the DemoQA platform through robust UI and API test cases. All test cases are documented and managed in [Qase.io](https://app.qase.io/projects), which is integrated with the automated test suite.

## 📋 Pre-requirements

Ensure the following are installed:

- Git `2.38.1` or later
- Node.js `v22.13.0` or later
- npm `11.2.0` or later

To check the versions:

```bash
git --version
node -v
npm -v
```

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ceciliasampaioqa/demoqa-cypress-tests.git
cd demoqa-cypress-tests
npm install
```

## 🚀 Running the Tests

Local Execution

- Headless: npm run cypress:headless

- Interactive (Cypress GUI): npm run cypress:open

Qase Integration
To execute tests and send results to Qase:

```bash
npm run test:qase
```

Test reports can then be viewed in the "Test Runs" section of Qase.

## 📚 Test Coverage

Test scenarios are grouped by feature and follow a structured naming convention:

```bash
cypress/e2e/alerts_frame_windows.cy.js
└─ Alerts, Frames & Windows
  ├─ Browser Windows: new tab/window
  └─ Alerts: immediate, delayed, confirm, prompt

cypress/e2e/book_store_application.cy.js
└─ Book Store Application
  ├─ API: List books, User login, Get user data

cypress/e2e/elements.cy.js
└─ Elements
  ├─ Text Box: form submission
  ├─ Check Box: multi-selection
  └─ Radio Button: option selection

cypress/e2e/forms.cy.js
└─ Forms
  └─ Practice Form: validation (empty and filled)

cypress/e2e/widgets.cy.js
└─ Widgets
  └─ Progress Bar: fill, completion, and reset
```

## 🧪 Qase Test Management

All test cases are available and maintained in Qase, including detailed steps, types, and expected results.

🔗 Access Qase Project: https://app.qase.io/projects

Email: ceciliasampaio.demoqa@gmail.com

Password: Teste@123

Navigate to the "Demo QA" project.

### Explore:

```
Repository: Written test cases

Test Runs: Results and history of automated/manual test executions

Defects: Bugs reported during the process
```

Qase is also integrated with the automated suite, enabling direct result publishing from Cypress executions.

```
Cypress for E2E and API testing
JavaScript
GitHub Actions for CI/CD
Qase for test case management and reporting
```

## ✅ Best Practices & Architecture

```
Custom Commands used for scalability and reusability

Automated + Manual test case traceability through Qase

Organized test structure by feature

CI with GitHub Actions

Easily expandable with new features/tests

Sensitive files like cypress.env.json are excluded from version control (sent only for this exercise)
```

## ✅ Suggested Improvements

Report generation optimization: It is recommended to enhance the CI pipeline by automatically merging the .json files generated by Mochawesome and producing a unified HTML report after test execution.
This improvement aims to simplify result analysis by providing a centralized, user-friendly report for reviewing test outcomes and identifying failures more efficiently.

⚠️ Although the .json files are being correctly generated in the CI environment, the merge and final report generation steps encountered issues locating the files. This has been documented as a potential future enhancement.
